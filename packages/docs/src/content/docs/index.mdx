## How It Works

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Deploy a Hub" icon="rocket">
    Run the hub with Docker or from source. It serves the MCP endpoint that AI assistants connect to, plus a dashboard for management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enroll Agents" icon="laptop">
    Install lightweight agents on your servers. They connect outbound to the hub via WebSocket — no inbound ports needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask Claude" icon="magnifier">
    Claude calls Sonde tools to check disk usage, list containers, query logs, and diagnose issues across your fleet.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Read-Only by Default" icon="approve-check">
    Agents execute structured probe descriptors, never raw shell commands. All probes are read-only at the default capability level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="7 Built-in Packs" icon="puzzle">
    System metrics, Docker, systemd, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MySQL. Auto-detection finds what's installed and suggests relevant packs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defense in Depth" icon="shield">
    Nine security layers: privilege dropping, mTLS, payload signing, output scrubbing, pack signing, capability ceilings, attestation, policy engine, and audit logging.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Native" icon="setting">
    Built on the Model Context Protocol. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any MCP-compatible client.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

Deploy the hub:

```bash
docker run -d --name sonde-hub \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SONDE_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-16-chars \
  -v sonde-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/sonde-dev/hub:latest
```

Install an agent on a target machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sondeapp.com/install | bash
```

Add Sonde to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add sonde --transport http https://your-hub:3000/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

Then ask: *"What's the disk usage on my-server?"*
